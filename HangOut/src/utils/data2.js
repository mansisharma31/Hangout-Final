It is an amazing take on the classic gajar ka halwa and we highly recommend it. The Palak Patta Chaat & Chicken Biryani are definitely up there on the list as well.

    "description": "Vidyarthi Bhavan, a heritage South Indian vegetarian restaurant, started in 1943 as a small student's eatery (from where it gets its name), has become a place that makes up part of the culinary history of Bangalore and which has metamorphosed into what it is today, a place where time and tradition have stood still, drawing people from all walks of life. It all started as a small canteen keeping in mind to cater needs of the students of the nearby National High School and Acharya Patashala. Venkataramana Ural, from a place called Saligrama near Udupi, set this up in the early 1943-44. Passed on to the hands of his brother Parameshwara Ural, the restaurant bloomed to its demand." ,

    "description": " The Elephanta Caves are a group of ancient rock-cut temples located on Elephanta Island, about 11 kilometers (7 miles) off the coast of Mumbai. The caves date back to the 5th to 8th centuries and are dedicated primarily to the Hindu god Shiva, though there are also carvings depicting other deities like Vishnu and Ganesha. The island gets its name from a giant stone elephant statue that was once located at the entrance, although it has since been relocated to the Jijamata Garden in Mumbai. The Elephanta Caves are known for their intricate sculptures, including the iconic Trimurti– a massive three-headed image of Shiva, symbolizing the god's three aspects: creation, preservation, and destruction.",
